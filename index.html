 <p style="font-size:25px">Although Hume’s more conservative contemporaries denounced his writings as works of scepticism and atheism,
his influence is evident in the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam Smith.<br> Kant reported that Hume’s work woke him from his <u>“dogmatic slumbers”</u>and Jeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume <u>“caused the scales to fall”</u> from his eyes.</span></p></p>

<p><strong><h3<p style="font-size:35px">Life</h3></strong>
 <p style="font-size:25px">Hume was born on 26 April 1711 (Old Style), as David Home, in a tenement on the northside of Edinburgh's Lawnmarket.
He was the second of two sons to Joseph Home, an advocate of Ninewells, and Katherine Home (née Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer.
and Katherine Home (née Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer. Joseph died just after David's second birthday, so Katherine, who never remarried, raised Hume and his brother on her own.
Hume changed the spelling of his family name in 1734, as the surname 'Home' (pronounced like 'Hume') was not well-known in England. Hume never married and lived partly at his Chirnside family home in Berwickshire, which had belonged to the family since the 16th century. His finances as a young man were very "slender", as his family was not rich and, as a younger son, he had little patrimony to live on.
Hume attended the University of Edinburgh at an unusually early age—either 12 or possibly as young as 10—at a time when 14 was the typical age. Initially, Hume considered a career in law, because of his family. However, in his words, he came to have

<p><I><p style="font-size:25px">…an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring.</i>

<p><p style="font-size:25px">He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that "there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books". He did not graduate.
